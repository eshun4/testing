Introduction: History Podcast
 
Charlie: Have you ever wondered what the largest man-made disaster was in Idaho history? It occurred on June 5, of 1976. This disaster was the collapse of the Teton Dam.

Thesis Statement:
Mallory: Hey! In case you haven’t heard, we want to share about the Teton Dam disaster and how it affected the people of Rexburg.

Mallory: Why was the Teton dam built?  

Charlie: it was believed by some the dam would provide flood control and water storage for agriculture and recreation purposes.

Mallory: Some fishermen believed that the dam would be bad for the fishing industry. 	Others believed that it would be good for fishing and imagined themselves boating on the reservoir.

Charlie: Land prices would have gone up with the building of the dam, because of the greater availability of water for farming and recreation.

Mallory: Some also believed the Teton Dam could create hydro-electric power. In the end, the dam collapse destroyed all these dreams.  

Charlie:  Why did the dam break?  

Mallory: Nearly 50 years after the dam collapse, the answer as to the cause of the failure is still not completely clear. 
	
Charlie: Some think the dam began to break with cracking of the dam's impervious core due to internal erosion. The grout curtain was also inadequate in preventing erosion along the edges of the dam.

Mallory:  But like most disasters, the cause had multiple factors.

Charlie: On Thursday, June 3, 1976, workers noticed two small leaks coming from the dam, but believed it was insignificant as it was considered to be typical in most earthen-filled dams during initial filling.

Mallory: At 10 AM another seepage area was found with faster running water and they began alerting everyone of the danger that was soon to follow.

Charlie: A surge of water burst out of the face of the dam.

Mallory: Imagine that a wall of fast moving water was coming toward your home. What would you do?

Erwann: Hello Mallory and Charlie I’m Lawrence Benson and I lived in Rexburg
 when the dam broke.

Mallory: Hi! We have some questions for you.

Erwann: Ask away!

Mallory: How old were you when the disaster happened?

	Erwann: I was about 20 years old.

Charlie: Where were you when the dam broke? 

Erwann: I was at my house in Rexburg. My older brother George came over and told me the dam was going to break. Our home was not in the floodplain so we went to help prepare George’s  house for the flood.

Mallory: What did you do to prepare for the flood?

Erwann: Well, we didn’t think it was going to be as big as it was. We ran around putting rugs and other things that were on the floor up onto the  couch and table. We thought they would stay dry up there.  In the end, none of this effort paid off. It all got ruined.

Charlie: Anything else you want to share.

Erwann: So many lives were affected that day. I feel lucky that my parent’s home was not destroyed.

Charlie:hWell thank you for coming! 

Charlie and Mallory: Bye!

Mallory: With such a big disaster you might wonder how much it cost. Overall it cost about 40 million dollars to build the dam. Some people think the dam was a waste of money, but was it? To quote Roger Olsen, a retired geologist from Rexburg, Idaho, “Lots of people said this was a huge disaster, but we learned so much from this failure. It probably saved thousands of people's lives in the long run. The lessons learned from the dam failure were applied to earth-filled dams worldwide.” 

Charlie: The huge waves of 80 billion gallons of water caused about 2 billions dollars in damages, which is about ten billion dollars today! Not to mention the eleven lives along with 13,000 cattle.

Mallory: That must have traumatized a lot of people!  
	
Charlie: Thousands of people's lives were changed that day. Many people came from as far away as New York just to help clean up and support the community.
Almost 50 years later, you can still see the scars of the Teton Dam collapse in Rexburg, Idaho and up and down the Snake River Plain.
	
Mallory: Natural disasters leave an imprint on our homes and our hearts. The people who were in Rexburg, Idaho, in June of 1976 will never forget. 

Mallory: We’d like to thank Mrs. Barton for helping us make this podcast.
	Charlie:And Roger Olsen for providing us with information and loads of support.
Mallory: And huge thank you to Lawrence Benson for letting us interview him!
Charlie: We’d like to challenge you to learn more about the history of the Teton river and its people! And thank you for listening to our podcast!
